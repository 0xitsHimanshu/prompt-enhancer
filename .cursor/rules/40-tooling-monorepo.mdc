# Tooling & Monorepo Commands

- Use Bun for scripts. Common commands are in [package.json](mdc:package.json) and app-level `package.json` files.
- Prefer running commands from the repository root unless a script is app-specific.
- Keep `turbo.json` tasks consistent; colocate build/test/lint config in each app.
- When adding dependencies, scope them to the app where used; avoid unnecessary hoisting.
- Document new scripts in the root [README.md](mdc:README.md).
