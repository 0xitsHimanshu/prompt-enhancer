# TypeScript Style and Conventions

- Prefer explicit types for exported APIs and function signatures.
- Avoid `any`; use discriminated unions and generics when possible.
- Use meaningful names; avoid abbreviations. Functions are verbs, variables are nouns.
- Use early returns and handle edge cases first.
- Keep try/catch minimal and purposeful; never swallow errors.
- Match existing formatting; avoid unrelated reformatting in edits.
- Keep comments short and purposeful; explain "why", not "how".
- Avoid deep nesting beyond 2â€“3 levels; extract helpers.
- In React components, type props with interfaces and return `JSX.Element`.
- Prefer `zod` or router-inferred types from tRPC procedures where applicable.
